# simplerisk-addons

Some simple-risk non official addons.

Those addons are NOT supported by simplerisk author / company and do not use any of their extras code. 

I do not offer support for those extras use at your own risk and the behavior is not expected to be the same as any official extra (to witch I do not have access).

## Docker immages 

My immage is based on ubuntu and php 8.1. 

To get the container image just pull the desired image tag. 

I use an ending code for each default language being en = english  and bp = brazilian portuguease the ones avaliable righ now
